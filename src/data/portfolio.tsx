        I led the full-stack overhaul of yarn, migrating from legacy HTML/CSS/JS
        to a modern{" "}

        application with{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold text-purple-300">SSR</span> for{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold text-purple-300">SEO</span> optimization
        and responsive interfaces. I managed a developer team using{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold text-purple-300">Agile</span>{" "}
        methodologies, guiding projects from ideation to deployment. Enhanced
        backend functionality by extending{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold text-purple-300">Python/fastAPI</span>{" "}
        and integrating APIs like Mailchimp. Drove strategic decisions on
        features and design to align with user needs and market demands.
        Implemented rigorous QA via Playwright (E2E) and Vitest (unit testing)
        to ensure product reliability.

        I built a poety website for a client using{" "}
